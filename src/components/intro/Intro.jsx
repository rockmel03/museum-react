          rebirth, but in this case, in a new form under a riverist national
          state project, in contrast to the concept of a grand homeland
          proclaimed by Artigas, under a federal, inclusive, and intercultural
          model, representative of rights, territorial sovereignty, and identity
          sovereignty. It also represents the people as a temporal rather than
          spatial identity, a concept rooted in the indigenous peoples such as
          the CharrÃºa and Guarani, from which he drew inspiration. In this work
          filled with foundational images of the nation, different layers of
          symbolism are present.`}
